# Cornell ML Course 2020 - Notes and hands-on applications

These are my own key-points and important take-downs for the ML Course of Cornell University CS5787 given by Volodymyr Kuleshov in Fall 2020. The course covers almost all topics on ML and hopefully as hands-on as I desire (I may edit this).

For the coding sessions I created a virtual enviorenment for python via "virtualenv CornellML" and source its activation file. Then install all the packages in requirements.txt, which is also in this folder (it is the same with the original, https://github.com/kuleshov/cornell-cs5785-2020-applied-ml/blob/main/requirements.txt).

Any solution or clear/better coding suggestions are welcome.
